This repository is the result of the coding challenge for Coffee MAchine store. This is the three line requirement for functinoality.
  You are in charge of creating a system that stores coffee machines. Each coffee machine has a brewing unit but only some have grinders.  
  For example, in future I may ask you to extend the design to store coffee machines with a WIFI coffee reordering module and so on. 
  How would an instance of a coffee machine be created? 

There are two different version of solution as you can see.

BasicSampleWithConsole - A sample console application to show how Coffee Machine builder works.
AdvancedSampleWithReactAndNetCore - A more Advanced version of application containing UI and BFF. UI is created with React and Typescript while BFF is created with .Net Core. 

Please review respective folder and their read me file for detailed instruction.
